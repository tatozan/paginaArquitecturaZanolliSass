                        <p>While it's obvious I have lost most of the blogging bug over time, I still enjoy getting
                            things up here every rare once and a while. And while there are innumerable topics to
                            discuss in this business, the more compelling ones tend to stem from a broader understanding
                            of what we're interacting with in the first place.

                            Interpretations of any market are often nothing more than an extension of the past
                            experiences (or lack of) of the observer himself. And while we want look at any market
                            through lenses which allow us to view them in the most complex of forms, they are, at the
                            end of the day, relatively simple mechanisms.</p>

                        <p>People buy. People sell.Price goes up. Price goes down.For something which, at its surface,
                            seems so simple manages to consume extraordinary amount
                            of time and effort because:Making money is the primary motive of any market.</p>

                        <p>Because of this, people quickly introduce a slew of descriptions which are usually nothing
                            more than myopic. “Surface level” is about as far as most people go, but at the surface
                            level, we're really dealing with nothing more than a distortion of reality.</p>


                        <h2 class="article-sub-title">So, What Is Price?</h2>
                        <p>The final product of any market is price. It is the last thing to occur in a long, drawn out
                            decision-making process, most of which is reactionary to events. These events are the work
                            of
                            different types of participants, behaving in many, many different ways. They could be driven
                            by
                            news, the actions of other participants, or anything else.

                            Price is the surface. Imagine if we knew nothing about what's underneath our own earth's
                            surface. And then an violent earthquake hits, or a volcano erupts, catching everyone
                            off-guard.
                            At one point in time, this is exactly the way things were. Without retelling the stories of
                            Pompeii, etc., we all know what happened.</p>
